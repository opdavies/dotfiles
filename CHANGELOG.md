# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com), but adapted to work with trunk-based development and continuous delivery.

Instead of grouping changes by tag, they are grouped by the date they are released.

## 21st November 2023

### Added

* Add CHANGELOG.md.
* More i3 key mappings for navigating between and focusing windows, as well as volume and brightness control.

### Changed

* Updated Harpoon mappings.
* Make the monitor ID and mode configurable in `switch-to-laptop-screen` and `switch-to-monitor` scripts.

### Fixed

* Prevent `markdownlint` from showing errors for line lengths and duplicate non-sibling headings, making it easier to work with files, such as CHANGELOG.md, that contains the same headings multiple times.
